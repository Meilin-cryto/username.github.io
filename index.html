    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Meilin Zhang, and I am a Mechanical Engineering major at the University of Florida. I am very interested in biomechanics and automotives. I have experience in 3D modeling, soldering , CSS, and HTML. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, listening to music, and playing video or puzzle games. I am looking for hands-on experience or opportunities in engineering that allow me to apply my academic learning and skills to real- world projects.
